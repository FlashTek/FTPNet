# FTPNet
Simple implementation of the FTP protocol (client side) using .NET 3.5

This repository is not actively maintained; but maybe this is still helpful for someone trying to implement the FTP protocol on their own.

The repository contains two implementations of the protocol:

- a very basic version for classic .NET 3.5 (for Desktop applications), no advanced features
- a extended version which can be compiled as a portable library with advanced features
